<li> For a fin with \(2\times2\) cm dimensions, and thickness of 1 mm, 
where \(5\, W\) of power is input along the entire left edge, the 
following plot was produced for the heat distribution based upon the PDE 
(8.44) in 
the textbook. The discretization used was \(M = N = 10\) steps in the 
\(x\) and \(y\) directions. The maximum temperature of the fin was 
determined to be 1.449356799942421e+02 degrees Celsius above ambient 
(1.649356799942421e+02 &degC).

<li>While increasing the size of the fin to \(4\times4\) cm, \(5\, W\) of 
power was input along the interval \([0,2]\) on the left side of the 
fin. The maximum temperature here was 28.125325223635254 degrees Celsius 
above ambient (48.125325223635254 &degC). Increasing \(M = N = 100\), the 
solution was found to be 46.365017323245070 &degC, a 3.7259001352796% 
difference using the mean relative error.

<li> After some search, it was determined that the maximum power that can 
be disipated given the input conditions of problem 2 was found to be 
around 6.26 Watts, for
\(M=N=50\), with  79.9165  &degC at the maximum. To claim more significant 
figures 
would be to claim unreal precision here given the trend of temperature to 
decrease slightly with increased number of steps. This maximum occured 
when 
moving the chip to the center of the edge. When the chip was kept at the 
bottom most 2 cm  of the edge, the maximum power that could be dissipated 
was 5.57 Watts.

<li> We were asked to replace the aluminum fin with a copper fin, which 
has thermal conductivity as \(K=3.85\, W/cm\) &degC, and find the maximum 
power that can be obtained by 4 by 4 cm fin with 2cm power input in the 
optimal placement, while keeping the maximum temp below 80 degrees.

<p>
We chose the optimal place to be the center of the edge so that it 
spreads out more effectively than having the power input on the side.
<p>

<p>
As a result, maximum power was \(7.59\, W\) and corresponding maximum 
temperature was 79.9776 &degC.

<li>
We were asked to plot the maximum power as the thermal conductivity 
changes from 1 to 5 \(W/cm\) &degC, while the maximum temperature stays 
below 80 
degrees. Through this experiment, we could tell that as the thermal 
conductivity increases, the maximum powers achieved for the temperature 
below 80 degrees got increased as well.

<li>
We were asked to find the maximum power for the water-cooled fin, as the 
convective heat transfer coefficient is \(H=0.1\, W/cm^2\) &degC.  For 
this case, the maximum power was \(43.08\, W\) and its maximum temperature 
was 79.9918 &degC.

<p>Comparing to problem #4 when we had \(H=0.005\, W/cm^2\) &degC, the 
maximum power in this case is much higher as the heat transfer coefficient 
was higher. With the maximum temperature \(7.68\, W\) achieved in problem 
4 only made the maximum degree to 30.5557 &degC, in this case, which is 
so much lower than 80 &degC. <p>

<li> 
Using the same parameters as in part 2, with the power being \(5\, W\), 
the boundary conditions were set everywhere to the neutral conditions, 
i.e. no power being supplied. However, a \(2\times 2\) square in the 
center had power added to it. The equations themselves were not modified 
as the heat conduction and convection remained the same, but the solution 
to the equations was set to the power condition as opposed to zero.

<p>Interestingly enough, it seems that the heat distribution is perfectly 
linear from the true center of the chip within a disk encompassed entirely 
on the cooling fin. This models the chip being placed at the center of the 
cooling fin. However, the maximum heat, and in fact, the average heat, 
seems significantly greater than when chip is connected to the side, 
likely due to more points being affected by the placement here. This model 
assumes that the chip has the same properties as the cooling fin.<p>
